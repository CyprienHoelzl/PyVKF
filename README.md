# PyVKF
Python implementation of second generation Vold-Kalman Order Filter.

Vold-Kalman Filter was introduced by HÃ¥vard Vold and Jan Leuridan in 1993. VKF extracts non-stationary periodic components from a signal using a known phasor. The solution involves solving a sparse linear system which in Python is optimally performed with spsolve. The second generation VKF, implemented here can extract multiple orders in parallel [2].
