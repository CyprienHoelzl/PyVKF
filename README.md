# PyVKF
Python implementation of second generation Vold-Kalman Order Filter.

Vold-Kalman Filter was introduced by HÃ¥vard Vold and Jan Leuridan in 1993. VKF extracts non-stationary periodic components from a signal using a known phasor. The solution involves solving a sparse linear system which in Python is optimally performed with spsolve. The second generation VKF, implemented here can extract multiple orders in parallel [2]. A matlab version of the same script, originally written by Maarten van der Seijs is the base of PyVKF [3].

VKF is adapted for filtering signals from rotary equipments components such as bearings and axles, where the frequency components are known and the signal is corrupted by noise. PyVKF has been successfully used to filter signals from Axle Box Accelerometers on Railway vehicles for filtering effects originating from vehicle and track. 
The VKF is proposed for decomposing the signal into periodic wheel and track related excitation--response pair functions. We demonstrate that these components are in turn correlated to operational conditions, such as wheel out-of-roundness and the rail type.

# How to run
* Create a new environment with python 3.7
* Install the requirements using:

```
(VKF)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Run the demo: [VKF Demo on synthetic data](VoldKalmanFilter.py).
